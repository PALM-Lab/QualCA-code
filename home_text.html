<h2>Welcome to quokka, a qualitative methods coding app.</h2>
<h3>Created by William XQ Ngiam, Lecturer in the School of Psychology at the University of Adelaide.</h3>
<h4>quokka is in alpha (v0.1.5). If you would like to share feedback, please email me at <em>william.ngiam@adelaide.edu.au</em>.</h4>

<h3>How to use this app:</h4><font size = "3"><ol>
<h4>Loading data</h4>
<li>Organize your <b>corpus</b> as a CSV file, such that the each <i>document</i> is a different row and the <i>document text</i> is contained in one column.</li>
<li>Upload your <b>corpus</b> CSV to QualCA using the button on the left-side menu. A drop-down menu will appear below to select the CSV column that contains the to-be-coded text, in case the corpus contains mutliple columns.</li>
<li>If you are returning to the QualCA app, you can upload your previously saved codebook CSV using the button on the left-side menu to continue your analysis.</li>
<h4>Coding</h4>
<li>Click the <b>"Coding"</b> tab on the sidebar to begin coding. You can scroll through the documents by pressing the 'previous' or 'next' buttons in the <i>Document Viewer</i> pane of the window. You can also type in a numeric value into the <i>Document # bar</i> to navigate to that document.</li>
<li>To add an extract to the codebook, highlight the text in the document using your cursor and press the 'Add Selected Text as Extract' button in the <i>Codebook</i> pane. When clicked, the highlighted text will appear in the <i>Extract</i> column, and will be highlighted in blue in the <i>Document Viewer</i>.</li>
<li>You can then add (or edit) a <i>Code</i> or <i>Theme</i> to an extract by double clicking on the relevant cell within the codebook table, and typing the new <i>Code</i>.</li>
<li>A <i>Counter</i> pane in the top-right of the app shows how many extracts are associated with each <i>Code</i>. You can edit a <i>Code</i> by double clicking on it in the <i>Counter</i>, and typing in the new <i>Code</i>. This will change the <i>Code</i> for all extracts associated with the old <i>Code</i>.</li>
<li>If you would like to apply an existing <i>Code</i> to a new extract, you may select the <i>Code</i> in the <i>Counter</i> before highlighting the to-be-extracted text. The Code will automatically be applied when you add the extract to the codebook.</li>
<li>The <b>"Research Question"</b> box is an open-text box that you can use to keep any relevant text. It is useful to keep your research question as you code, perhaps refining the question as you continue your analysis.</li>
<li>You can add a column to the codebook by pressing the <b>Add Column</b> button. This may be useful for keeping notes or other information alongside the extracts.</li>
<li>To save your progress, you can click the Download Codebook button in the left-side menu. The codebook is saved as a CSV file, which you can upload to QualCA on your next visit.</li>
<h4>Reviewing</h4>
<li>If you would like to review your coding so far, you can open the left-side menu and click the <b>"Reviewing"</b> tab. On this tab, the <i>Counter</i> will be shown in the top-left, displaying the codes so far and the number of instances for each code. Click on a code in the <i>Counter</i> to display all extracts that are associated with that code.</li>
<li>Click on an extract from the shown list to display the document containing that extract below in the Document Review box. Only the bottom-most extract will be displayed if more than one extract is selected from the <i>Extracts</i> list.</li>
<h4>Sorting</h4>
<li>Click on the <b>"Sorting"</b> tab on the sidebar to organise your codes into themes. All codes from your codebook will appear on the left-side.</li>
<li>To sort the codes, simply drag the desired code into the empty "bucket". To add more "buckets" indicative of more themes (or sub-themes), press the "Add theme" button at the top.</li>
<li>To save the current codes, press the "Download Themes" button. The output file is a CSV where each list will be saved as a separate column.</li>
